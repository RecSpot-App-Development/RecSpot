## Overview
### Description
The purpose of this app is to allow users to record a video that can then be edited with the use of filters and music taken from Spotify. To be more precise, the user will be able to record a video and then be given the options: edit the video and add music from Spotify. If the user simply wishes not to select these two options, they can just create/save the video they made. 


### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Entertainment/Music
- **Mobile:** This app is specficially designed for mobile devices since it is easier to create/edit videos on with the use of the mobile device's camera. Essentially, the user can create videos from any place they go, whether it being outside in the city with friends to walking your pet dog. Other devices such as the laptop would not be the best option for this specific app due the reason of not everyone taking their laptops everywhere they go, whereas our mobile devices are always with us. 
- **Story:** Allows users to select the music choices they want/the filters they want. Allows users to to engage in making enojoyable videos with either themselves or with their friends/family. 
- **Market:** There is no age restricition for this app, therefore any individual can use it. 
- **Habit:** If the user thoroughly enjoys making/editing videos, this app can be used everyday. 
- **Scope:** First version of this app will allow the user to simply record a video using the phone's camera and then to edit it. User can edit the video by using the built in filter options. User can then add trending music from Spotify to the video's background. This can evolve into a social media app where it will allow users to post their edited video and can be able to view other users video where they can like/comment on them.
